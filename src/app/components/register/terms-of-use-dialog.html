          <li>
              The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for all disputes between you and Copa shall be the courts located in Tel Aviv-Yaffo, and each party hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act are excluded from these Terms.

          <b>General.</b> We reserve the right to discontinue or modify any aspect of the Site and/or Service at any

          concerning the Service and the Site between you and Copa and supersede all prior agreements and
          representations related to the subject matter hereof. To the extent of any inconsistency or
          conflict between these Terms and an Order Form, these Terms shall prevail. Section headings are
          provided for convenience only and have no substantive effect on construction. Except for your
          obligation to pay Copa, neither party shall be liable for any failure to perform due to causes
          beyond its reasonable control. Nothing herein shall be construed to create any employment
          relationship, partnership, joint venture or agency relationship or to authorize any party to
          enter into any commitment or agreement binding on the other party. If any provision of these
          Terms is held to be unenforceable, these Terms shall be construed without such provision. The
          failure by a party to exercise any right hereunder shall not operate as a waiver of such
          party's right to exercise such right or any other right in the future. No waiver of any
          term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other
          term.
